            High Dive Ultimate got its start in the fall of 1994, when a Clarkson alumnus named Chris Yager introduced the game to a few fellow freshmen. The following year, an official Ultimate club was created with the name Squirrel Massacre; over 100 students attended the first interest meeting. The club was able to raise funds by hosting Disc Golf tournaments, and began attending tournaments a year later.
            <br><br>
            In 2001, members of the club opted to rename it to "something related to frisbee". Alumnus Gumby (that's absolutely his real name) chose the name "High Dive", and it's stuck ever since.
            <br><br>
            High Dive Ultimate continues to thrive at Clarkson, with new players of all skill levels joining each year. We primarily play in our home state of New York, but have travelled as far as Savannah, Georgia for tournaments.
