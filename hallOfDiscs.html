            In addition to travelling for tournaments, High Dive hosts two of our own every year. How we stay sober enough to do this is astounding.

        <h2>Head of the Pig</h2>
        <p>
            High Dive's longest running tournament, HOTP has been held every year since 2002. The first HOTP was held on September 7th and 8th, and the High Dive history books say the temperature exceeded 100 degrees. In Potsdam. In September. In. Potsdam.

            Dates for Head of the Pig 2017: September 16th & 17th 
        </p>
        <h2>Serious Floreplay</h2>
        <p>
            The younger, flirtier Clarkson Ultimate tourney has been around since 2007. The name comes from former frisbee freshman "Switch Hitter", who was once cited by police for "serious foreplay" during a state of extreme drunkenness.

            Dates for Serious Floreplay 2018: February 17th & 18th
            <br><br>
            Webmaster's note: these dates may be inaccurate because I wasn't paying attention in our E-Board meeting. Which was the only one I attended all semester.
